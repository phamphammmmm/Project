                Here, interior architect Pierre Yves Rochon has created a               <br>
                stunningly modern concept in touch with its environment,                <br>
                preserving the elegance of the house, “To find yourself in a            <br>
                prodigious place, in the open air, in the peacefulness of the Bois      <br>
                de Boulogne, in Paris, and there to enjoy cuisine by a great            <br>
                chef, all the while savoring the architecture of the building”.         <br>
                Green, black, white and silver are the dominant colors: green, as       <br>

                interspersed to mark spaces, enhance details, pilasters and bas-        <br>
                reliefs. The furniture, by turns in harmony or opposition with          <br>
                the architecture of the building, traditional and modern, thus          <br>
                accentuating this impression of purity and lightness.                   <br>
                An elegant and audacious setting for the cuisine of Chef                <br>
